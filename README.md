Machine Learning Alert Parsing

A system to match bank alerts with sales automatically.

## Problem Case:
A Company X, say an SME, selling clothes, bags and shoes offers cashless transactions, letting its customers make payment transfers for their desired item.
The business is left to sort out which bank transfer is for the payment of a particular item. Such payment could be in part too.

For example,
sales in a day include: 3k (bag), 2.5k (bag), 5k (shoes), 7k (clothes), 5.5k (clothes).
bank alerts received: 3k, 2.5k, 3k, 2k, 5.5k, 7k

## Solution:
MachineAlerts solves this problem with the aid of machine learning across all use cases where sales need to be matched to payment alerts.
